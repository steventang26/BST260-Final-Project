## Project Title
Predict COVID-19 Mortality Risk using Environmental, Behavioral, and Socioeconomic Factors among the U.S. Population

### Study Objectives
1. To investigate the effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on COVID-19 mortality through multiple waves of the pandemic
2. To use machine learning to predict the number of deaths COVID-19 deaths from 03/22/20 to 10/31/21 and whether or not a county will be above the median morality rate for all US counties
3. To understand if the trend in county-level COVID-19 deaths associated with long-term exposure to air pollution are the same before the introduction of vaccines as they are for the full period.

## How to Navigate
Welcome to our final project repository! For the ease of examining all of the work that went into our project, we recommend you open and knit the files in the order best allows for you to follow the projects creation. That is, we recommend that you start by opening our Overive file followed by the data acquisition and cleaning file to get a better sense of the raw data and the various sources they stem from. These are "Project Overview.Rmd" and "WebScraping_1211.Rmd" respectively. 

Next, we recommend looking at how COVID-19 mortality, as well as different socioeconomic and environmental factors in our data set vary across the US by using our Shiny App. This can be found in "Shiny_App-JGF.R". A web version can be found here https://jfarmer13.shinyapps.io/County-Level/?_ga=2.54148392.1651180538.1639334084-1021835638.1638130033 . 

Third, we suggest you follow our exploratory analysis with linear and logistic regression. This can be found in the "regression.Rmd" file.

Next, we recommend you look at the Support Vector Regression file that includes some additional exploratory analysis, as well as SVR models for a continuous and dichotomous outcome. This can be found in "XB_MLsection.Rmd"

Finally, we recommend you look at the Random Forest analysis that explores similar models as the SVR using a different Machine Learning method. This can be found in "Yu Fu Random Forest.Rmd"


### TL/DR

For the richest experience of this project, open and knit the files in the following order: 

1. "Project Overview.Rmd"
2. "WebScraping_1211.Rmd"
3. "Shiny_App-JGF.R"
4. "regression.Rmd"
5. "XB_MLsection.Rmd"
6. "Yu Fu Random Forest.Rmd""
